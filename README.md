# PASSWORD_DECODER


Welcome to Password_Decoder, a Python program designed to assist you in decrypting hashed passwords using brute force techniques. This tool provides options for decoding SHA1 and MD5 hashes. To use Password_decoder, simply input the cipher text you wish to decode and select the corresponding decoder type. To exit the script, input '3'. Let's delve into the world of password decryption with Python!


## Features

- SHA-1 Hasher
- MD5 Hasher




## Technologies Used

- PYTHON
- Brute Force Attack

## Usage Instructions :


- Download the contents of The Repository as a Zip File or clone the Repository.
- Install Python in your Machine
- Install the python packages mentioned inside the requirments.txt file by the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt #for windows
pip3 install -r requirements.txt #for macos and linux
```

- Run the Decoder.py file by running python Decoder.py or python3 Decoder.py on it.
- Then select the type of hash you want to decode (type only the number corresponding to the action and not the word itself)
- Then enter the actual hash you want to decode and wait for the script to try decoding it, if possible it shows the text password, if not it displays a relevant message.


## After Installation 

- For Testing This Script visit this website [Codebeautify.org](https://codebeautify.org/sha1-hash-generator)  and get the SHA-1 Hash or MD5 Hash as you want.
- Now copy that cipher text to the Script and run the Script and wait
- Congratulations !!! 
- YOU FOUND THE PASSWORD FOR HASH !!!
